The Lords of Light and Darkness, seeing the danger they posed for the balance of nature, banished them to a separate plane of existence, trapped with no means of escape from inside. It would take eons before the combined effort of foolish sorcerers and the most dreadful Demon Lord to ever exist would allow Uria unleash her hordes on a ravaged land.\n"
